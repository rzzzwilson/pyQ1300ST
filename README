This is a rewrite of mtkbabel-0.8.3.1 from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtkbabel/].
This version will try to be more pythonic in things like reading from the device (use
generators?)

The file mtkbabel.pl is the base file from the above project.  The mtkbabel.py is the
python rewrite.  The log.py file is a logging module for debug.

The file mtkbabel.bin is a binary dump of the device memory.  Reading this makes
debugging quicker.

The file data2kml.py converts a GPX file output by mtkbabel.pl into a Google Earth
KML file.

NOTE: the original development of this was done on OSX.  Unfortunately, since
Yosemite (10.10) the QStarz BT-Q1300ST device isn't mounted under OSX.  Development
was switched to Linux (XUbuntu) at that point.
